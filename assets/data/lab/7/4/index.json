Set this equal to <strong>choices[randomIndex</strong> ]. The computer will randomly choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors as their choice each round</li>\n<li>The <em>playerChoice</em> and <em>computerChoice</em> variables are only available inside this function right now. We will need these later, so attach them to the global window object. For example, <strong>window.playerChoice = playerChoice</strong></li>\n<li>Create an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">if conditional</a> to test if <em>playerChoice</em> is equal to <em>computerChocie</em>. If this evaluates to true, it means the player and computer chose the same choice and the round should result in a tie.</li>\n<li>In the statement for this if conditional, temporarily use a <code>console.log()</code> and log some text to the browser's console saying the round was a tie. Include a <strong>return</strong> statement after the console.log statement. Whenever a browser gets to a return statement, it will break out of the function at that point. If a round is a tie, the <em>playRound</em> function will stop executing here since nothing else needs to be done</li>\n<li>Create another if conditional. Set the condition to see if <em>playerChoice</em> is equal to \"Rock\". If the player has chosen \"Rock\", we now need to compare it to what the computer has chosen to determine if the player won or lost. Inside the if statement, make another if/else conditional to check what the computer chose. If the computer chose \"Paper\", the computer won and the computer's score should be incremented by 1. If the computer chose \"Scissors\", the player won and the player's score should be incremented by one.</li>\n<li>Use <code>else if</code> conditionals to repeat the same process as above if the player chose \"Paper\" or \"Scissors\"</li>\n<li>Inside each conditional, also console.log out some text saying who won and who lost</li>\n<li>After the conditionals, let's change the value of the the player and computer's score on index.html to reflect the changes. At the top of main.js, under the <em>buttons</em> variable, create two new constants: <em>playerScoreText</em> and <em>computerScoreText</em>. Use document.getElementById to select the respective elements from index.html</li>\n<li>Back in the <em>playRound</em> function, set the innerHTML of these two elements equal to the scores of each player.</li>\n</ol>\n","path":"/lab/7/4/","start":false,"last":false}},"context":{}}

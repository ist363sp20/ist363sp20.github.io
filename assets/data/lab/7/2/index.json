This array will be used to store the different choices a player can make for their hand sign. By using an array, it'll simplify expanding the game later on if you wish to add onto it by using 5 hand choices instead of 3 (such as the popular Lizard-Spock additions)</li>\n<li>Add three strings to the array: <strong>\"Rock\"</strong>, <strong>\"Paper\"</strong>, and <strong>\"Scissors\"</strong></li>\n<li>Under the choices variable, create two new variables using the <strong>var</strong> keyword called <em>playerScore</em> and <em>computerScore</em>. Set both of them equal to the number zero (0). These variables will act as counters to keep track of the number of points each player has throughout the game.</li>\n<li>Create one more variable using the <strong>const</strong> keyword and name it <em>winningScore</em>.
